// Facility for associating extra data to a HANDLE, without actually replacing the handle itself.
// This allows associating key data such as normalized path and effective policy at the time of handle open,
// for use in HANDLE-only APIs such as GetFileInformationByHandle.
//
// HANDLE is effectively typed as void*. Why not indirect handles by returning a pointer to some structure wrapping the real handle?
// That's only viable so long as ALL HANDLE-consuming APIs are detoured (even boring things like GetHandleInformation); otherwise
// any missing API would reject our fake HANDLEs, or crash.
//
// Instead, we define a process-global HANDLE -> overlay map and return all HANDLEs unmodified.
