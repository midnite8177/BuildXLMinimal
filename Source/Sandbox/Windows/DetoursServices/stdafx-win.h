// Peculiar warning about binding an rvalue to a non-const reference. But this appears to be in std::map? Instantiations seem fine.
// Allegedly triggered by HandleOverlay.cpp, but suppressing there doesn't work for some reason.
#pragma warning (disable : 4350)

// warning C5039: 'function': pointer or reference to potentially throwing function passed to extern C function under -EHc. Undefined behavior may occur if this function throws an exception.
// Setting /Wall will cause this to get hit for many that the Windows SDK violates in almost every source file in detours.
#pragma warning( disable : 5039)
// warning C5045: Compiler will insert Spectre mitigation for memory load if /Qspectre switch specified
// This spectre mitigation has been applied to detours, however this warning will continue to show up with /Wall enabled
#pragma warning( disable : 5045)

// In order to compile with /Wall (mega pedantic warnings), we need to turn off a few that the Windows SDK violates.
// We could do this in stdafx.cpp so long as a precompiled header is being generated, since the compiler state from
// that file (including warning state!) would be dumped to the .pch - instead, we stick to the sane compilation
// model and twiddle warning state at include time. This means that disabling .pch generation doesn't result in weird warnings.
