// The children of a TreeNode. Exposes a mutable associative collection of wstring to TreeNode*.
// In most cases a TreeNode do not have too many children, so the class is optimized to deal with the case of a lower
// number of children.
// The implementation uses a vector as the underlying initial container and switches to an unordered map after the threshold capacity is met. The rationale
// is that a vector behaves better (and has lower footprint) than a map for a low number of elements
// The class assumes a relatively low number of deletions: once the threshold is reached the map is used for the remainding lifetime of the instance
// All comparisons againt the key are case insensitive, following the functionality of PathTree
// This class is not thread safe
