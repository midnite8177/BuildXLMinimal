/// GetPartialPathAndRemainder
///
/// Takes a path and trims out the first partial path. Because the contract
/// for this and all functions is not to modify or copy strings, return the
/// length of the partial path, and the caller will use absolutePath along
/// with the return value and treat that as if it were the partial path.
/// Keep in mind that said partial path string is not null-terminated.
///
/// Remainder is the string beginning after the dividing path separator.
///
/// Returns:
///     The length of the partial path, not including the null terminator or path separator.
/// Outputs:
///     absolutePath (unmodified): The partial path (as a prefix of absolutePath), with no path separator.
///     remainder: The remainder of the input string after the partial path has been stripped off.
