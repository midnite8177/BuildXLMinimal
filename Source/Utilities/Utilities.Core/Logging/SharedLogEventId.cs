         * Please do not add any new events in this class. 
         *
         * New events should be added to LogEvent.cs next to the Log.cs file that
         * uses the identifier. 
         *
         * The only reason for adding an event here would be if you would be using the eventid
         * from an assembly that would cause a cycle in the build graph. I.e. if Utilities needs
         * an ID reference to a log event from the Engine. But if the Engine needs the logId of
         * an event form the scheduler, you can just add a direct dependency.
